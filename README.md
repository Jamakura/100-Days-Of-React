# 100-Days-Of-React

## ðŸ¤” What is React100?

The #React100 challenge is a commitment to learn React for the next 100 days. We are using the challenge as an accountability tool where techies would come together, go through tutorials weekly, and learn in a judgement-free zone. If you're anything like me, you've done the #100daysofcode journey. You've spent countless hours learning lessons and pushing code. The process of learning is fun; however, it can be very lonely and overwhelming as time goes on. This is why the #React100 Slack community was formed. We are able to tap into a community of React developers of all levels, expertise, and experiences. This community has supported and encouraged me to keep growing into the developer I want to become and I couldn't appreciate it more!

## ðŸ“‹ Whatâ€™s the plan? 
* Code for a **minimum** of an hour a day
* Share progress on social media each day with the hashtag #React100
* Mon-Fri: Tutorials and Learning
* Sat-Sun: Build a small React Project

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
